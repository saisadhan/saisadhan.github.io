I see the programming as a stepping stone to the problem solving and I see data as an accurate record of a real-life scenario; be it a problem or a solution. I love to discover the problem behind the numbers and find the solutions with them.\nMy programming journey began in junior high school where I really enjoyed the process of creating cool solutions in a form of applications. It has always felt rewarding and, the excitement has extended my abilities from building the small applications to the bigger more complex ones which uses machine learning.\nWith the advent of AI and machine learning, my feeling for the data and its use has solidified. This is exactly what I want to do! It makes me feel astonished at how vast amounts of data can be made use of in such benefiting ways. What first started as a novice learning took the form of a passion, a desire to decode and understand the technology to its core.\nI am passionate about Data Analytics, Business Analytics, and Programming, and I look forward to harnessing every opportunity to learn better.\n Currently seeking opportunities for Business/ Data Analysts, consultant, and Business Intelligence Engineer Current student of Industrial engineering at NYU, expect to graduate in May 2021  The following are my technical abilities:\n Programming - Python, R, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript Data Visualization - Tableau(certified), Seaborn, Matplotlib Front End frameworks - Node.JS and ReactJS    Download my resumé.\n","date":1618605961,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1618605961,"objectID":"50391f9e2cf03573969f5d19b38f738d","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"Hello, I am Sai sadhan Saravanan, a programming enthusiast who loves to seek logic behind technical solutions.
